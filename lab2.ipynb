You can also find an implementation of the Layer Fidelity experiment [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-device-benchmarking/blob/main/notebooks/layer_fidelity.ipynb) using `qiskit-experiments` module, whereas, in this notebook, we will directly use Qiskit Runtime Primitives for circuit execution.\n",

For a circuit of depth $d$ (for even $d$), we randomly sample 1q Clifford gates for $d/2$ layers, and then we invert the circuit for the last $d/2$ layers. This provides a simple implmentation for our purposes, and the details of this difference are beyond the scope of this lab.\n",
    "2. We perform 1q Clifford sampling by taking advantage of the fact that for backends whose single qubit gates are composed of $R_z(\\theta_1) \\sqrt{X} R_z(\\theta_2) \\sqrt{X} R_z(\\theta_3)$, when $\\theta_i \\in \\{ \\pm \\pi / 2, \\pm \\pi, 0 \\}$, the resulting single qubit gate is a Clifford.
