# QGSS

1. This year’s Qiskit Global Summer School featured ten online lectures delivered by various IBM Quantum experts, as well as nine live Q&A sessions hosted by IBM Quantum education leads John Watrous and Olivia Lanes. 
2. The two-week-long program started by giving students a thorough overview of foundational quantum computing topics — with this year’s curriculum emphasizing quantum software as opposed to quantum hardware before moving on to more advanced material. 
3. Participants had to complete four labs on topics like quantum circuit transpilation, noise-model building, and more.
